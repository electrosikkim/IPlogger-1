# IP Logger
Functioning IP Logger. Requires Repl.it db. 
# Setup
It's ready to use. If you would like to store ips in the ips.txt file, uncomment
```javascript
fs.appendFileSync('ips.txt', ip + "\n");
```
on line 25 in index.js

### Stuff To Note:
I don't care how you use this.

Contact Me at paradoxdotexe@protonmail.com for any concerns

This is part of an upcoming project that functions similarly but does not log ips.

This is partly satire.

If you would like to test this, go to: [Here](https://IPlogger.pepelaugh.repl.co)

If you do go there, note that your IP will be stored in a database, but it will not be publicly available. Feel free to use a VPN
